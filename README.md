# Social Network Analysis Homework

## Project Overview

This project involves conducting Social Network Analysis (SNA) to help marketing specialists identify key individuals to target within a limited budget. The analysis is performed on a dataset called `connections.txt`, which represents a list of edges in a directed graph.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Create a Directed Graph

- Implement a directed graph using the data provided in `connections.txt`.

### 2. Identify Bridges

- Determine which nodes act as bridges within the directed graph.

### 3. Calculate Graph Density

- Evaluate the density of the graph and provide insights based on your findings.

### 4. Analyze Node Connections

- Identify nodes with the highest and lowest number of connections.

### 5. Examine Incoming and Outgoing Connections

- Identify nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections.

### 6. Measure Centrality

- Calculate and present the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality for nodes. Interpret your findings.

### 7. Implement Community Detection Algorithm

- Apply a community detection algorithm to the directed graph and determine the number of communities created.

### 8. Explore Community Sizes

- Identify the largest and smallest communities. Provide insights into your findings.

### 9. Visualize Top 3 Communities

- Draw the largest three communities and remove the top 3 nodes with the highest centrality measures (Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, and Eigenvector) from each community.

### 10. Visualize Influencers

- Draw the influencers within the top 3 communities.

### 11. Design an Action Plan

- a. Define a hypothetical business (e.g., telecom, marketing agency).
- b. Specify a hypothetical marketing budget.
- c. Set a hypothetical cost per action (advertisement cost).
- d. Based on the analysis, decide which nodes should be targeted to maximize the impact within the budget constraints.
